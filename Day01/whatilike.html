    <p>
        When I was young, my parents never allowed me to have pizza with pepperoni in it because it is "bad for my health." 
        <br>
        Now that I'm grown up, I care none of that stuff and have as much peppernoi as possible in my pizza.
        <h2 style="color:red;font-size:350%;">SO YUMMY!</h2>
